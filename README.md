# TIC - TAC - TOE 
This game is made  by  using REACT.JS .

The most ancient board games still played today is tic tac toe. This is probably because it's so simple that you don't even need a board to play! But even with all its simplicity, the history of tic tac toe is more rich and surprising than you'd think.

Path :-
1 The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
2 You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
3 The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
4 When all 9 squares are full, the game is over.


Thank you .
